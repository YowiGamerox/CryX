The first question asks you if you want to **Create a file**, **Scan a file** or **Delete the entire file folder**

* Creating with **C**
* Scanning with **S**
* Deleting with **D**

-- Creation --
The program asks you if you want to *Encrypt* or *Uncrypt* (then it will create a file with the content)
You answer with **E** for *Encrypt* or **U** for *Uncrypt*.

It will input the text to encrypt or decrypt and a shift.
The shift is a number that works as a password. 
(The shift is a number that moves the characters as many positions the number is)

After that, it will ask you if you want to send an email with the content to someone. (It will do it for you)

You have to write:
* The email *sender* (by default your email)
* The email *recipient* (the person who it will receive the email)
* The email *subject* (the title of the email)
* The email *body* (the message that it will appear in your email)
